SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Java Runtime Environment 1.5 or higher, Sun/Oracle JRE recommended

A database server, e.g. PostgreSQL (drivers included for version 8.2, 8.3, and 9.1) or Microsoft SQL Server (drivers included)
Instead, you can also use Apache Derby embedded database (included)
(using Apache Derby is the default configuration, so you can test GoldenGATE Server without setting up a database)



SETTING UP A GoldenGATE Server

TODO describe configuration and installation as deamon



ACCESSING GoldenGATE Server VIA CONSOLE

TODO console access



INSTALLING COMPONENTS IN GoldenGATE Server

TODO component installation
